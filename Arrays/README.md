## 1️⃣ Two Sum

Problem: Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

### Approach:
I used a simple brute force method.
- Check every pair of elements.
- If their sum equals target, return their indices.

### Time Complexity:
O(n^2)

### Space Complexity:
O(1)
